## Project Report

### Reflection
I found this project to be interesting to say the least. There were a lot of things in the Godot engine that I was exposed to, although I was happy to realize that it generally follows a relatively simple logical structure (ie, that of scenes, nodes, signals, etc). I do have experience in a Lua based "engine" which is itself written in Unity. The project is called "CYF" (formerly called "Unitale"). It essentially was designed to allow users to create fan made encounters/battles for the game "Undertale" (hence the original name). It accomplishes this by providing the user with a number of lua scripts that can be edited to control just about every aspect of the system. I mention this because my previous experience with using anything that can be considered a game engine has been entierly script based. There is no node panel, no properties panel, etc, everything is done via editing the lua scripts. When I started the tutorial I initially felt very good about the extra features this engine provides, however as I continued on it began to rub me the wrong way slightly, and I found myself yearning for the simpler (if more rudimentary) system I was familiar with. By the time I finished with the tutorial however, I had come to the conclusion that although learning a new system may be somewhat uncomfortable, in the end, some systems are better suited to some tasks than others. For example, the system Godot uses would be much better suited for a larger scale game that is more complicated than what I have previously attempted to make.
